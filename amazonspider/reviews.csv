R2OMA8CHVALO6Q,Even The Best Camera Won't Work Without Better Software & Hardcore Hardware,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've had several GoPros (a half dozen over the years), and I'm a early-adopter of consumer 360 video. This camera was specifically purchased to replace my Samsung Gear 360 which easily produces 360 video, but has sub-par video quality. Given that the GoPro Omni runs about $1,400, the GoPro Fusion is a steal at less than half that cost."
R3W3JCMV8YE5BQ,"So far impressed, but the complete lack of easily found documentation makes it difficult for the uninspired.","Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I will update this review in a few days, there are a couple of statements I need to state.  First, the documentation is completely void from this camera.  If you don't have the appetite for ""figuring it out"" then don't bother.  GoPro, you can do better in sending a simple 10 page quick start guide, I know all the materials are in the video but...  I first did not know where the buttons were, I finally figured that out, then by accident paired with the phone and from there things became easier.  The software at first glance looks fine, of course I will figure out more once I start using it more heavily."
RYFUBELV4SJC2,Awesome 5.2K Spherical Videos; not so awesome software.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'll start by saying that the Fusion delivers really clean 5.2 K spherical video and it's really fun to shoot with. Using the free Fusion Studio app on Mac (haven't tried the Windows version), you can render out very nice video images with gimbal-like stabilization. It's the best stabilization I've ever seen on a 360 camera. Even with walking and micro vibrations, the hardware/software combination yields buttery-smooth movement. Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls ""overcapture"" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage. So GoPro has to improve how the app is using the CPU. Assuming your clips are relatively short and you're patient, (let the clips render overnight) the camera is truly the best 360 camera I've used (and I've used a lot of them).

R2EWTH6VJV5452,Doesn't work with its own softwarep- makes it extremely difficult to use,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The camera seems to take excellent 360 photos, and short videos as far as I can see from my mobile gopro app. But the big caveat is that the desktop software, Fusion Studio, that you are supposed to use to unload all of the massive images and videos to your desktop simply does not work.  Trying to connect my camera to my mac has taken hours, and it still isn't working.  It is NOT simple plug and play.  This is clearly a known issue due to the number of times the connectivity problem appears in online gopro help forums, but there is simply no substantive help that works anywhere.  This is extremely frustrating - you spend time taking videos and you rely on the camera, and you cannot unload the footage without popping the cards out and unloading those - that is a much more complex method than on a normal gopro  or other digital camera. Very very frustrating for such an expensive camera.

R1CHM6F48JFQR7,"Looks Great, shoots in night and day","Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The iPhone app is buggy, but you don't need it, it's a 360, think about your placement of the camera and shoot.  The images are night and day over my Insta360 Nano, as it can shoot in night and day too.  The Fusion software running on a 2010 Mac Pro 5.1, is so far rock steady doing almost 100 clips.  My Mac Pro is a basic Intel cheese grater model with 24GB RAM and a Sapphire 580 8GB GPU.  The render time is approx 11 minutes to render 1 minute of 5.2k Cineform.  I do own DaVinci Resolve Studio 15 (the paid one, you can buy a Resolve Dongle on an auction site for cheap).  The Cineform 5.2k files playback a little choppy on editing, but not enough of a problem to edit with."

  Hardware and image quality are fantastic. Required stitching software is as buggy as everyone says.  I render on a desktop and rendering time is not a problem (10 min of footage takes ~6-7 min to cineform at full resolution). However the fusion software regularly crashes. Worse, the “recover project” option only results in more crashing. Therefore, user has to start project from scratch regularly. It is infuriating. The fusion desktop software is useless. Without the software, the hardware is useless.  The camera came out 1.5 years ago. If they haven’t fixed the software yet, they probably never will.

  Pretty amazing 360 camera if you have the computer to render the files. It uses 2 different micro sd cards, one for the front cam and one for the back cam. You have to download “fusion studio” which is a barley stable program. Crashes 1/3 of the time you use it. Anyway you have to render the two files together with that program and depending on your computer, can take forever."

  Overall the camera is great it's a little big but not a big deal I have it mounted on my motorcycle on my left handlebar to record in front of me and behind me for when I go to work in case I get into an accident or something. The battery life seems to drain at 1% per minute give and take and I wish I had a separate battery to exchange them instead of charging up the single battery since it takes awhile also you have to use the original cable to connect to the computer if you want to transfer content not just charge it. Overall it works great for what it is I bought it for 200 like couldn't imagine paying more than that for what the camera does.

  The biggest thing with the 360 camera is the editing, and through my experience it is very flawed. You need a laptop strong enough  to handle the incredibly awful experience of transporting your photos. The computer program crashes often. Takes hours to render any videos and they still look awful in the end."
R2CD2I27FD9RBK,Happy with it so far,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this after considering a Nikon KeyMission for some time. It got better reviews and was a higher megapixel rating so I hoped the image quality would be better as well. The movie quality is pretty good. Rendering the video though requires a pretty new or reasonably powerful computer. The software is slow to scan and not as intuitive as I'd like. YouTube videos helped me more than the GoPro website. The camera has a GPS so there is telemetry data available, however it appears the GoPro software won't make use of it. Hopefully that will change in the future. It's a shame to not be able to use that and stay in the GoPro software. I had to download a third party application and I'm still learning how to use that properly. Overall I'm happy with it, just wish the software was simpler to use.

  The Fusion has its flaws - like any other brand - but for what it's worth I'm happy, happy enough to buy a second one.  Shooting (and editing) in 360 is not only a learning curve, but introduces technical challenges in storage and rendering speed. The problems I see people run into can be experienced with any 360 camera. Overall I think the Fusion is in the top 3 for consumer level 360 cameras in the price range.

  I've had GoPro's in the past but this one was just difficult. The app didn't want to pair with my Samsung Galaxy 9+, but it would with my husband's S9. There are so many 360 cameras on the market these days...and so many still entering the market, I think GoPro totally missed the mark on this one. I found it cumbersome and having to use 2 micro SD cards makes stitching, etc more difficult. I hope their next-gen 360 is better!

The basic features of the camera are so easy to use that my 7-year old niece uses it sufficiently, but it has advanced features for professionals who want more control of its functionality. Editing is separate from the actual product review, but it is very important when considering to buy this camera. If you have plans to use computer software, make sure that the computer meets the specifications required for rendering.

  Hello everyone. I had trouble, not with the purchase or the seller or the camera, but with getting the two sides of the camera into the stitching program. After much trouble, and getting a ""218"" error from the go pro fusion software, I finally found the simple thing that nobody mentions about importing footage. If you buy a fusion, put both folders from GPfront and GPback (the front and back folders that show up on the cards when you record) into another folder together....call it ""footage"" or whatever. Then the GoPro software will import without the ""218"" error (and no explanation).......GoPro should have this right up front in their website or documentation....but that would be too easy. .Just trying to save someone else the hassle of researching this simple answer. cheers

  This is a fun toy/tool. I bought it to make documenting the as-built condition of buildings easier. The tripod is really neat for travel but it isn't very tall. It comes with 2 spare mounts and I was able to use one on my 6ft quick release tripod. The model is discontinued though so don't expect many future updates to the software.  Inital firmware update process aside, it was pretty easy to use. You will need two memory cards. But the camera auto stitches the images together into a spherical image you can pan around in by touch or by moving your phone. Excellent starter device for exploring 360 image creation!

  This camera was released in 2017 but it is entirely incompatible with my smartphone that's less than a year old.

R3AOOYQ89XQ4D4,Prosumer Camera lacking even BASIC image controls.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Short and sweet.  How can a camera of this price, category, and technology omit the MOST BASIC OF ALL CAMERA FUNCTIONS?  I can think of no camera released in the past 10yrs that costs 1/10th of this one that blows off the implementation of Exposure and White Balance Control.  Literally, you CANNOT lock your exposure or WB and cannot choose shutter speeds.  Sure..AUTO EVERYTHING with a simple +/- EV control can work fine in easy environments... but go in and out of shadows, mixed light...shoot time lapse, etc and watch that exposure and white balance bounce all over the place.  I honestly expected more from GoPro and it never even crossed my mind that these BASIC features would be excluded.  For me, I may just have to return it as I cannot accept these limitations no matter how great it looks in bright even sunlight.  PLEASE FIX THIS and I may repurchase.  Interesting that there are so many comments marked ""Helpful"" when they are ""rah rah""...but there are some big-time shortcomings that people should consider and not be swayed exclusively by only positive reviews.  One additional - Be sure you don't mind a 10x-15x to 1 rendering ratio on even the latest of computers.  1min of footage will take 10-15min to render.  For reference, my latest top of line Macbook Pro it's 10 to 1.

  Fusion is a great idea but unlike most of the GoPro products, it needs a lot of refinements. I had lots of issues in making it work for the first time and am still getting used to it in making decent videos. But my main frustration is that GoPro does not make it clear that it is useless underwater - the primary reason I bought it; the optics simply do not work underwater, image becomes soft and you can clearly see stitching lines."

  I will not reiterate the criticisms of other users that are well documented (long transfer and render times). My biggest issue is that the desktop app does not allow for key framing of the over capture files. That is to say when you convert a 360 video to a regular video you can only re-frame in one static direction. If the subject of the video moves in relation to the initial direction you have directed the overcapture then you are stuck.  For me this is a major shortcoming. I am fine with long transfer and render times if the output is good (which it is). However, if you can not create the cool panning effects or in and out of the 'small planet view' then what is the point of shooting 360? Insta360 and Rylo apps both support this feature in the free editing app. I realize there are plugins for Adobe Premiere that allow this, but this is not a solution for those of us with investments in other editors.

  I bought the GoPro Fusion just because I was curious whether 360 photography/videography actually makes sense for someone who doesn't use a VR headsets and is not into extreme sports. After playing with the Fusion just for a few minutes I already got pretty excited and then took it with me on a 2 week trip through Japan. The photos and videos I could take with the Fusion are simply incredible - the fish eye and little planet videos look simply cool and the 360 photos/videos let you feel you're back on vacation even weeks after you're back home. The Fusion will from now on go on every trip with me! My only wish for the future, please make the GoPro apps and FusionStudio better (much better ;))

R1AYIFTEMT42SI,GoPro Fusion,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The Fusion captures everything in clear, sharp high definition. Unlike a normal single field-of-vision video or photo camera the image is a spherical/fish-eye virtual reality (VR) 360 degree view, so nothing is missed. But, if the intension is to share anything but VR, the output needs to be precisely edited to make useable.  Operating this camera entails a number of software programs and an app as well downloading and installing files, etc. This is not a plug and play device."

  Potentially great hardware that will never be great because gopro doesn't care. The problem is the software, it's terrible. And since their software is the gatekeeper this means your footage is useless. Specifically the desktop app crashes, doesn't get updated often enough, and is horrendously slow. Worse yet the Android software blocks use unless you have a compatible phone. So after waiting months for it to work on my OP5, I get an OP6, and I'm out in the cold again.

  This is a great camera.  The video it takes looks amazing, better than anything else I've seen in the price range.  The pictures are great too.  It really adds an extra level to your vacation pics and vids when you can look around 360 degrees. I looked at a few alternatives, and the Fusion just had the best, natural looking videos, with the best color.  The app and desktop software is where it really falls off.  The app isn't fully functional on Samsung phones for some reason (only the world's largest phone manufacturer, that's all). You can't share videos from the phone.  The desktop software requires a really high-end CPU and a decent video card, and it's still very slow to render.  While on vacation I was able to render 360 pics on a cousins cheap laptop, but had to wait until I got home to render 360 video."

  I was on the fence about 360 cameras but decided to take the plunge as these were on sale  and im so glad I did.  please note you WILL  need a very good spec computer to use this camera or dont waste your time getting it  You must  have atleast a 2017 or later computer with  a i5 processor  or better along with 16gb of ram and a dedicated graphics card with minimum 4gb of ram and 500 gb hard drive. The software would not render files on my i7 2015 computer with 12 gb of ram  and would run super slow on a MacBook . I upgraded to a 2019 i7 with 16gb of ram and a nvidia 1650 grafics card and everything works butter smooth and reasonable fast .  The editing that could be done with a 360 camera is just amazing and looks like you have your own camera person this is the future of video.

  initially, I was impressed by the feel of this camera and the immediate preview on my phone was great to, but it literally ended there. Despite trying various usb ports, cables, and numerous suggestions found online I was unable to pull the footage off the camera and into the GoPro software. even when I pulled the SD cards and manually downloaded it, the software wouldn't recognize the files and spit out errors. its a shame because it was super simple to use out of the box but anything beyond hitting record is a nightmare. it also has constant issues turning on, i find myself having to pull the battery out, put it back in, just to get it to turn on. once its on, it works great, the voice commands and all, but getting it on is a challenge most of the times. I had it for about 48 hours and tried for nearly the same amount of time to pull the footage I captured on the first day. no luck, so, until they fix the software and crap ton of other issues, stay away from this bs.

  The footage captured with the camera is excellent. Let's start there. The stitching is really, really good as well. However.....software. This is a camera without a viewfinder or screen of any kind, so the only way you can tweak settings or actually SEE what you are shooting is by linking it to a phone or tablet. That's where this review lost three stars. Both the phone app and the software are MAJOR Cons that anyone purchasing this product needs to be aware of."

R25WQJL7BCGE4V,Amazing Footage.  Everything Pales to a 360.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am GoPro obsessed.  I have 2 Sessions, Heros 4,6,7 (got to recycle the older versions) and now the Fusion.  Granted, I have never owned a 360 camera before, but I have been very satisfied with the GP Fusion.  I don't do too many fancy things with it.  We are an all Mac household so I stitch and edit videos through my desktop.  It runs more slowly on smaller devices but runs very well on my higher processor desktop.  Everything else pales in comparison to the 360 if you take into consideration the 3D nature of the videos.  The video quality will catch up eventually, given the new software in beta.  I am very much looking forward to these improvements and remain a hardcore avid customer/fan of GoPro.  Now if only there's a way to stick a fusion to your body whilst doing active extreme sports, that would be fantastic. ;)

R2R92DEYMSVJ6V,Camera does not work correctly with Mac OS 10.14.2 or OnePlus 6T,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My GoPro Fusion shows black when I try to use the GoPro app as a preview screen (I have a OnePlus 6T). Also, when I take a picture and download it, it shows black in the GoPro app when I try to view the image. The app also fails to recognize that I downloaded any images or video.  This camera has been way more trouble than it's worth. I bought a new computer to handle the bloated software, but the Fusion software doesn't work correctly to import images directly from the camera on Mojave OS 10.14.2.  For GoPro customer support, all troubleshooting and a multitude of customer service calls have been useless.  They are also refusing to give me a refund.  A camera this expensive should not have such issues.

R2WT6COUA0DFPE,Niche Product Great for those with $$$ and Time,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Like an exotic sports car the up-front cost is only a portion of the capital investment you are making. Sure, if you already have an expensive smartphone you can connect to the GoPro fusion via the app and get some usability, but this approach has limitations with respect to stitching the image together into one, clear, spherical image. Where the GoPro Fusion really shines is when the images are processed on a desktop computer, the image is beautiful as if you are looking through a literal ""eye in the sky"". The one caveat (and it's a big one) is your desktop computer must be an absolute BEAST of a machine in order to process the footage in any reasonable amount of time, if at all before the RAM is exceeded and you have to give up hours later. To put this in perspective, you will probably need a video-processing desktop currently priced at $2K-$3K+. I have been successful at making clips up to 5 minutes long work on my computer with 8GB RAM and 2G DDR5 GPU, however, that is only after I had to tune down the resolution to 2K, and the stitching process still took over an hour. On the back end, the stitched videos are not compatible with past versions of the GoPro Studio software, which is a remarkably good and intuitive means of video editing (GoPro why did you move away from this?). As an alternative, GoPro opted to offer a GoPro Fusion toolbox for an Adobe video-editing software, which is only available via a subscription basis, minimum $20 per month with no option to straight-up purchase. At face value, this is an excellent option for a professional in the video-editing field, but I have neither the patience nor the presence to justify changing what has already worked in the past for me. I gave Adobe an honest attempt, but perhaps my computer was not up to par, nothing seemed to work."
R3M9MU9W8L7VX9,"Easy to use, difficult to export usable files","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  While the GoPro Fusion is a very easy camera to hold, record and operate the ability to download and convert these files to usable videos is labor intensive.  The software that pairs with the camera is ""okay"" at best and the conversion process is very SLOW...even on a high-powered computer.  I would also like to note that the highest quality conversions in 5k crash my computer.  I'm running an i7-6700k 4 GHz with 32 GBs of Ram and a GeoForce GTX 1080.  This should not be a problem, but it is.  Still happy with the purchase, frustrated with its downfalls.

  Picked up a unit and put it to the test and love it. The software update made a huge difference in stabilization and a night and day improvement. Make sure you use the APP and get the updates!  The stitching is so seamless you cannot even tell where it is which is the key differentiation to the competition. The entire over capture feature is hands down the reason to buy this! This is a must have for architecture and interior photographers and I think with continued updates this by far is going to be a clear winner.

They only had 24 hours to shoot and because of their remote location, could not get a new camera. They are now heading home with no footage yet - it cost me over $15,000 for their time and expenses.

RXYSXISYPL08U,The tech behind this concept is miles away from GoPro's engineering capabilities,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Everything started with the purchase of the most overpriced, under-performing, unreliable camera I have ever seen. Bought a Session 5 right before a 28 days cruise. The camera just wouldn't work properly at all. After reading through the sea of complains in the forums a potential reason was shown (the memory card type could be the problem). I don't know enough about hardware to fully understand the complexity behind memory cards but if it is a subject so complicated then a memory card of the ""right"" type should be sold with the cameras. I wanted to return the camera right away but being in a cruise I missed my return window. I took the lost of $300 and moved on deciding to never give GoPro a chance with their poorly designed cameras. Today I get an email asking for my GoPro experience feedback. Decided that providing some constructive criticism would be useful. To my surprise, the survey had absolutely nothing to do with my experience with a GoPro camera at all! The survey was full of questions regarding demographics. I was in such a disbelief that GoPro would mask a demographic data collection survey as an experience feedback survey to bait people into providing data for GoPro's marketing. Maybe if your engineering team worked as well as your marketing team then GoPro wouldn't have the massive amount of unsuccessful products (such as Karma drone) out on the market. I had already been disappointed by GoPro beyond  repair but after this baiting survey, I will campaign as much as possible against your horrible products and your amazingly dirty social engineering methods of business.

  Die Fusion ist der Beginn der Zukunft. Insbesondere bei Action-Aufnahmen muss man sich nicht mehr darum kümmern den gewünschten Bildausschnitt auch wirklich ins Bild zu bekommen. Man positioniert die Kamera einmal und nimmt nur noch auf. Danach bearbeitet man alles am PC und sucht sich die gewünschten Perspektiven aus. Overcapture bietet unglaubliche Effekte und ist einfach genial. Die Bildqualität erstklassig, zumal man zB für YouTube Videos in der Regel auf 1080 Auflösung herunter geht. Also Bilder mega. Kamera selbst, gut, aber mit Verbesserungspotential. Die hervorstehenden fischaugenartigen 2 Linsen sind extrem exponiert und ohne jegliche Schutzoption. Die Möglichkeiten des Linsenschutzes wie bei Gopro Hero gibt es bisher nicht. Hier muss noch etwas nachgeholt werden. Ausserdem fehlt eine Öse an der Kamera um eine Sicherungsleine zu befestigen. Da man die Fusion ohne Case verwendet, und es auch keines dafür gibt, kann man an der Kamera selbst keine Safetyline anbringen, nur an der Schraube."

  Das Konzept der Kamera gut, es macht viel Spaß damit aufzunehmen. Es wäre alles gut, wenn da nicht die notwendige Nachbearbeitung wäre. Die Windows-Software, die dafür nötig ist (GoPro Fusion Studio) ist schlichtweg eine Katastrophe. Sie beansprucht für die Bearbeitung _alle_ Systemressourcen, auch jeglichen freien Speicherplatz auf der Systemplatte. Das wäre ja auch noch in Ordnung, leider stürzt sie im Schnitt bei jedem zweitem Render-Prozess ab und gibt den belegten Festplattenplatz NICHT WIEDER FREI. Das Windows-System ist dadurch nur noch eingeschränkt nutzbar. Die Anfrage an den GoPro Support (nur in englisch) offenbart die generelle Taktik: ABWIMMELN. Ich habe das Problem geschildert, der Mitarbeiter hat es bis zum Schluss nicht verstanden und die Konversation endete mit der Aufforderung, ""ich solle jemanden Fragen, der sich mit Computern auskennt"". Dazu muss ich sagen, ich bin selbst Softwareentwicker. Es wurde mir versprochen dass sich ein ""Experte"" mit mir per eMail in Verbindung setzt, das ist nach mehrere Wochen immer noch nicht passiert. Jegliche erneute Anfragen zum gleichen Thema werden konsequent ignoriert. Für mich gibt es nur einen Begriff dafür: UNPROFESSIONELL.

  I used this camera this winter and the quality is amazing.  For a good discount, all the 'quirks' of this camera can be looked past and overcome, if you can work with the footage on a computer.  Like other GoPro cameras this one too will randomly freeze up sometimes, but pulling the battery out to reset the camera fixes this.  If I had paid the full original price, I would have returned it, but I paid less than half of that."

  This is my 4th GoPro. Not like other gopro easy to use which I understand since this fusion is 360 camera. Good thing is catching wide 360 videos without seeing selfie stuck. Also long battery life. A little tricky thing is you have to use two SD cards together all the time and I still didn't figure out how to stiches videos. I basically just screen recording when I play the videos on my phone. Plus the video quality is way lower than regular gopro I have.

  I wanted to really like this camera, but GoPro's desktop and mobile app to process the 360 footage needs more work before it's ready for consumer use. The minimum computer requirements for the desktop app is totally understated by GoPro. The graphics card needs to be at least a GTX 1050 for reasonable stitching times (6 minutes of stitching time for every minute of footage). The mobile app for iOS needs proper stitching for 360 stills. 360 video stitches fine on the phone, but stitching for 360 stills is practically non-existent. How did software quality control miss this??? And there's also no way to control the horizon orientation when panning around 360 footage - it just spins in seemingly random directions. GoPro, please take a look at how Ricoh did their app for the Theta and take some notes.

  Totale Enttäuschung, Gopro hat massiv nachgelassen. Hatte vorher die Hero 4. Die Fusion macht zuerst einen guten Eindruck, doch hat massive Detailschwächen: Beim Surfen eingesetzt, kommt Sand durch die Dichtungen und macht das Öffnen des Akkuschachts extrem schwergängig. Für den anderen Schachthat sich die Abdceckung beim Öffnen komplett verabschiedet. Konnektivität funktioniert nur zu Quick, nicht zu Mac. Das ist echt Mist, und hätte ich bnoch die Originalverpackung, würde ich das Ding einfach zurückschicken. Schade, so macht Gopro sich selbst kaputt

  Die Actioncam ist für vielfältige Einsätze bestens geeignet. Sie ist mit ca. 7,5 x 7,5 x 4 cm sehr kompakt und robust gebaut. Die Oberfläche ist gummiert und was besonders gut ist, alle Kanten sind abgerundet. Die beiden Kameraaugen stehen logischerweise hervor, sonst könnte man den 360 Grad Winkel nicht gut abdecken. Sicherlich ist hier besondere Vorsicht geboten, denn schon beim Hinlegen liegt die Kamera immer auf der Linse. Das mitgelieferte kompakte Cover ist daher sehr praktisch, weil man die Kamera dort sehr gut, schnell und sicher verstauen kann. Die beiden Klappen für den Akku und die beiden microSDHC-Karten einerseits und den USB-C Anschluss andererseits sind als Schub- und Gelenk-Klappen ausgebildet. Sie lassen sich trotz der Dichtungen leicht bedienen. Die Funktionsweise ist relativ einfach, zuerst wird die Klappe mit der innenliegenden Dichtung mit dem Schubdeckel fest angedrückt und der Schubdeckel eingeschoben. Dadurch wird verhindert, dass sich die Dichtung mit der Zeit abreibt und undicht wird. So eine Konstruktion ist immer eine sehr gute und dichtungsschonende Variante, die auf Langlebigkeit ausgelegt ist. Sicherlich müssen die Dichtungen und die Schubrillen auf Sauberkeit überprüft werden, denn Schmutz und Staub können die Klappenmechanik erheblich beschädigen. Die Tasten zum Öffnen der Klappen sowie die beiden Bedienschalter sind gut zugänglich, bedienbar und funktionieren sehr gut. Das Display zum Einstellen der Funktionen ist ca. 1,5 x 1,5 cm groß und gut beleuchtet. Die Symbole, Zahlen und Buchstaben sind gut lesbar. Auch die Bedienung durch die beiden Tasten ist sehr gut. Die Menüführung und die Einstellungen sind selbsterklärend und genau so muss es sein. Hier können Einstellungen für Videos, Photos, Zeitrafferaufnahmen, Sprachsteuerung und die Verbindungsart für die Kommunikation mit dem Smartphone, PC-Tablet usw. vorgenommen werden. Es stehen beide Bänder für WLAN zur Verfügung 2,4 GHz und 5 GHz. Der Akku ist ein Li-ion Akku mit 2620 mAh. Schade, dass hier nicht zwei AA-Standard-Eneloope-Akkus mit zusammen 5000 mAh gewählt wurden, denn vom Platz her würden sie passen. Man könnte schnell mal zwischendurch die Akkus wechseln und zusätzlich hatte man noch die doppelte Kapazität. Die zwei nicht im Lieferumfang beinhalteten microSDHC-Karten müssen immer sehr schnelle Karten sein. Wir verwenden bereits bei unseren Smartphones und Dashcams die SanDisk microSDHC mit UHS-I oder höher sowie mit Class 10. Langsame SD-Karten werden der Actioncam nicht gerecht. Der GoPro typische Anschluss lässt sich nach dem Lösen der beiden Arretierklappen herausschieben und je nach Bedarf austauschen."

R2OMA8CHVALO6Q,Even The Best Camera Won't Work Without Better Software & Hardcore Hardware,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've had several GoPros (a half dozen over the years), and I'm a early-adopter of consumer 360 video. This camera was specifically purchased to replace my Samsung Gear 360 which easily produces 360 video, but has sub-par video quality. Given that the GoPro Omni runs about $1,400, the GoPro Fusion is a steal at less than half that cost."
R3W3JCMV8YE5BQ,"So far impressed, but the complete lack of easily found documentation makes it difficult for the uninspired.","Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I will update this review in a few days, there are a couple of statements I need to state.  First, the documentation is completely void from this camera.  If you don't have the appetite for ""figuring it out"" then don't bother.  GoPro, you can do better in sending a simple 10 page quick start guide, I know all the materials are in the video but...  I first did not know where the buttons were, I finally figured that out, then by accident paired with the phone and from there things became easier.  The software at first glance looks fine, of course I will figure out more once I start using it more heavily."
RYFUBELV4SJC2,Awesome 5.2K Spherical Videos; not so awesome software.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'll start by saying that the Fusion delivers really clean 5.2 K spherical video and it's really fun to shoot with. Using the free Fusion Studio app on Mac (haven't tried the Windows version), you can render out very nice video images with gimbal-like stabilization. It's the best stabilization I've ever seen on a 360 camera. Even with walking and micro vibrations, the hardware/software combination yields buttery-smooth movement. Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls ""overcapture"" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage. So GoPro has to improve how the app is using the CPU. Assuming your clips are relatively short and you're patient, (let the clips render overnight) the camera is truly the best 360 camera I've used (and I've used a lot of them).

R2EWTH6VJV5452,Doesn't work with its own softwarep- makes it extremely difficult to use,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The camera seems to take excellent 360 photos, and short videos as far as I can see from my mobile gopro app. But the big caveat is that the desktop software, Fusion Studio, that you are supposed to use to unload all of the massive images and videos to your desktop simply does not work.  Trying to connect my camera to my mac has taken hours, and it still isn't working.  It is NOT simple plug and play.  This is clearly a known issue due to the number of times the connectivity problem appears in online gopro help forums, but there is simply no substantive help that works anywhere.  This is extremely frustrating - you spend time taking videos and you rely on the camera, and you cannot unload the footage without popping the cards out and unloading those - that is a much more complex method than on a normal gopro  or other digital camera. Very very frustrating for such an expensive camera.

  The iPhone app is buggy, but you don't need it, it's a 360, think about your placement of the camera and shoot.  The images are night and day over my Insta360 Nano, as it can shoot in night and day too.  The Fusion software running on a 2010 Mac Pro 5.1, is so far rock steady doing almost 100 clips.  My Mac Pro is a basic Intel cheese grater model with 24GB RAM and a Sapphire 580 8GB GPU.  The render time is approx 11 minutes to render 1 minute of 5.2k Cineform.  I do own DaVinci Resolve Studio 15 (the paid one, you can buy a Resolve Dongle on an auction site for cheap).  The Cineform 5.2k files playback a little choppy on editing, but not enough of a problem to edit with."

  Hardware and image quality are fantastic. Required stitching software is as buggy as everyone says.  I render on a desktop and rendering time is not a problem (10 min of footage takes ~6-7 min to cineform at full resolution). However the fusion software regularly crashes. Worse, the “recover project” option only results in more crashing. Therefore, user has to start project from scratch regularly. It is infuriating. The fusion desktop software is useless. Without the software, the hardware is useless.  The camera came out 1.5 years ago. If they haven’t fixed the software yet, they probably never will.

  I bought this after considering a Nikon KeyMission for some time. It got better reviews and was a higher megapixel rating so I hoped the image quality would be better as well. The movie quality is pretty good. Rendering the video though requires a pretty new or reasonably powerful computer. The software is slow to scan and not as intuitive as I'd like. YouTube videos helped me more than the GoPro website. The camera has a GPS so there is telemetry data available, however it appears the GoPro software won't make use of it. Hopefully that will change in the future. It's a shame to not be able to use that and stay in the GoPro software. I had to download a third party application and I'm still learning how to use that properly. Overall I'm happy with it, just wish the software was simpler to use.

  The Fusion has its flaws - like any other brand - but for what it's worth I'm happy, happy enough to buy a second one.  Shooting (and editing) in 360 is not only a learning curve, but introduces technical challenges in storage and rendering speed. The problems I see people run into can be experienced with any 360 camera. Overall I think the Fusion is in the top 3 for consumer level 360 cameras in the price range.

  Hello everyone. I had trouble, not with the purchase or the seller or the camera, but with getting the two sides of the camera into the stitching program. After much trouble, and getting a ""218"" error from the go pro fusion software, I finally found the simple thing that nobody mentions about importing footage. If you buy a fusion, put both folders from GPfront and GPback (the front and back folders that show up on the cards when you record) into another folder together....call it ""footage"" or whatever. Then the GoPro software will import without the ""218"" error (and no explanation).......GoPro should have this right up front in their website or documentation....but that would be too easy. .Just trying to save someone else the hassle of researching this simple answer. cheers

  GoPro Fusion is an outstanding product, but it does *not* seem to be ready for use yet (at best, I'd call it a ""beta"" or ""alpha"" version). The camera firmware, as well as the mobile app (using iOS app on iPhone X), are both very buggy, unreliable and rather frustrating to deal with."

  I wanted a 360 camera for when taking vacations to capture spherical photos and videos of my travels for use in my VR headsets. I looked at reviews and samples and wanted the highest possible image quality without getting in to professional costs, which lead me to the GoPro. It lives up to the hype on image quality, and the stabilization is awesome. That is unfortunately where the good note ends."

R3AOOYQ89XQ4D4,Prosumer Camera lacking even BASIC image controls.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Short and sweet.  How can a camera of this price, category, and technology omit the MOST BASIC OF ALL CAMERA FUNCTIONS?  I can think of no camera released in the past 10yrs that costs 1/10th of this one that blows off the implementation of Exposure and White Balance Control.  Literally, you CANNOT lock your exposure or WB and cannot choose shutter speeds.  Sure..AUTO EVERYTHING with a simple +/- EV control can work fine in easy environments... but go in and out of shadows, mixed light...shoot time lapse, etc and watch that exposure and white balance bounce all over the place.  I honestly expected more from GoPro and it never even crossed my mind that these BASIC features would be excluded.  For me, I may just have to return it as I cannot accept these limitations no matter how great it looks in bright even sunlight.  PLEASE FIX THIS and I may repurchase.  Interesting that there are so many comments marked ""Helpful"" when they are ""rah rah""...but there are some big-time shortcomings that people should consider and not be swayed exclusively by only positive reviews.  One additional - Be sure you don't mind a 10x-15x to 1 rendering ratio on even the latest of computers.  1min of footage will take 10-15min to render.  For reference, my latest top of line Macbook Pro it's 10 to 1.

  Fusion is a great idea but unlike most of the GoPro products, it needs a lot of refinements. I had lots of issues in making it work for the first time and am still getting used to it in making decent videos. But my main frustration is that GoPro does not make it clear that it is useless underwater - the primary reason I bought it; the optics simply do not work underwater, image becomes soft and you can clearly see stitching lines."

  I will not reiterate the criticisms of other users that are well documented (long transfer and render times). My biggest issue is that the desktop app does not allow for key framing of the over capture files. That is to say when you convert a 360 video to a regular video you can only re-frame in one static direction. If the subject of the video moves in relation to the initial direction you have directed the overcapture then you are stuck.  For me this is a major shortcoming. I am fine with long transfer and render times if the output is good (which it is). However, if you can not create the cool panning effects or in and out of the 'small planet view' then what is the point of shooting 360? Insta360 and Rylo apps both support this feature in the free editing app. I realize there are plugins for Adobe Premiere that allow this, but this is not a solution for those of us with investments in other editors.

  I bought the GoPro Fusion just because I was curious whether 360 photography/videography actually makes sense for someone who doesn't use a VR headsets and is not into extreme sports. After playing with the Fusion just for a few minutes I already got pretty excited and then took it with me on a 2 week trip through Japan. The photos and videos I could take with the Fusion are simply incredible - the fish eye and little planet videos look simply cool and the 360 photos/videos let you feel you're back on vacation even weeks after you're back home. The Fusion will from now on go on every trip with me! My only wish for the future, please make the GoPro apps and FusionStudio better (much better ;))

  The Fusion captures everything in clear, sharp high definition. Unlike a normal single field-of-vision video or photo camera the image is a spherical/fish-eye virtual reality (VR) 360 degree view, so nothing is missed. But, if the intension is to share anything but VR, the output needs to be precisely edited to make useable.

  Potentially great hardware that will never be great because gopro doesn't care. The problem is the software, it's terrible. And since their software is the gatekeeper this means your footage is useless. Specifically the desktop app crashes, doesn't get updated often enough, and is horrendously slow. Worse yet the Android software blocks use unless you have a compatible phone. So after waiting months for it to work on my OP5, I get an OP6, and I'm out in the cold again.

  This is a great camera.  The video it takes looks amazing, better than anything else I've seen in the price range.  The pictures are great too.  It really adds an extra level to your vacation pics and vids when you can look around 360 degrees. I looked at a few alternatives, and the Fusion just had the best, natural looking videos, with the best color.  The app and desktop software is where it really falls off.  The app isn't fully functional on Samsung phones for some reason (only the world's largest phone manufacturer, that's all). You can't share videos from the phone.  The desktop software requires a really high-end CPU and a decent video card, and it's still very slow to render.  While on vacation I was able to render 360 pics on a cousins cheap laptop, but had to wait until I got home to render 360 video."

  I was on the fence about 360 cameras but decided to take the plunge as these were on sale  and im so glad I did.  please note you WILL  need a very good spec computer to use this camera or dont waste your time getting it  You must  have atleast a 2017 or later computer with  a i5 processor  or better along with 16gb of ram and a dedicated graphics card with minimum 4gb of ram and 500 gb hard drive. The software would not render files on my i7 2015 computer with 12 gb of ram  and would run super slow on a MacBook . I upgraded to a 2019 i7 with 16gb of ram and a nvidia 1650 grafics card and everything works butter smooth and reasonable fast .  The editing that could be done with a 360 camera is just amazing and looks like you have your own camera person this is the future of video.

  initially, I was impressed by the feel of this camera and the immediate preview on my phone was great to, but it literally ended there. Despite trying various usb ports, cables, and numerous suggestions found online I was unable to pull the footage off the camera and into the GoPro software. even when I pulled the SD cards and manually downloaded it, the software wouldn't recognize the files and spit out errors. its a shame because it was super simple to use out of the box but anything beyond hitting record is a nightmare. it also has constant issues turning on, i find myself having to pull the battery out, put it back in, just to get it to turn on. once its on, it works great, the voice commands and all, but getting it on is a challenge most of the times. I had it for about 48 hours and tried for nearly the same amount of time to pull the footage I captured on the first day. no luck, so, until they fix the software and crap ton of other issues, stay away from this bs.

  The footage captured with the camera is excellent. Let's start there. The stitching is really, really good as well. However.....software. This is a camera without a viewfinder or screen of any kind, so the only way you can tweak settings or actually SEE what you are shooting is by linking it to a phone or tablet.

  I am GoPro obsessed.  I have 2 Sessions, Heros 4,6,7 (got to recycle the older versions) and now the Fusion.  Granted, I have never owned a 360 camera before, but I have been very satisfied with the GP Fusion.  I don't do too many fancy things with it.  We are an all Mac household so I stitch and edit videos through my desktop.  It runs more slowly on smaller devices but runs very well on my higher processor desktop.  Everything else pales in comparison to the 360 if you take into consideration the 3D nature of the videos.  The video quality will catch up eventually, given the new software in beta.  I am very much looking forward to these improvements and remain a hardcore avid customer/fan of GoPro.  Now if only there's a way to stick a fusion to your body whilst doing active extreme sports, that would be fantastic. ;)

R2R92DEYMSVJ6V,Camera does not work correctly with Mac OS 10.14.2 or OnePlus 6T,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My GoPro Fusion shows black when I try to use the GoPro app as a preview screen (I have a OnePlus 6T). Also, when I take a picture and download it, it shows black in the GoPro app when I try to view the image. The app also fails to recognize that I downloaded any images or video.  This camera has been way more trouble than it's worth. I bought a new computer to handle the bloated software, but the Fusion software doesn't work correctly to import images directly from the camera on Mojave OS 10.14.2.  For GoPro customer support, all troubleshooting and a multitude of customer service calls have been useless.  They are also refusing to give me a refund.  A camera this expensive should not have such issues.

  Like an exotic sports car the up-front cost is only a portion of the capital investment you are making. Sure, if you already have an expensive smartphone you can connect to the GoPro fusion via the app and get some usability, but this approach has limitations with respect to stitching the image together into one, clear, spherical image. Where the GoPro Fusion really shines is when the images are processed on a desktop computer, the image is beautiful as if you are looking through a literal ""eye in the sky"". The one caveat (and it's a big one) is your desktop computer must be an absolute BEAST of a machine in order to process the footage in any reasonable amount of time, if at all before the RAM is exceeded and you have to give up hours later. To put this in perspective, you will probably need a video-processing desktop currently priced at $2K-$3K+. I have been successful at making clips up to 5 minutes long work on my computer with 8GB RAM and 2G DDR5 GPU, however, that is only after I had to tune down the resolution to 2K, and the stitching process still took over an hour. On the back end, the stitched videos are not compatible with past versions of the GoPro Studio software, which is a remarkably good and intuitive means of video editing (GoPro why did you move away from this?). As an alternative, GoPro opted to offer a GoPro Fusion toolbox for an Adobe video-editing software, which is only available via a subscription basis, minimum $20 per month with no option to straight-up purchase. At face value, this is an excellent option for a professional in the video-editing field, but I have neither the patience nor the presence to justify changing what has already worked in the past for me. I gave Adobe an honest attempt, but perhaps my computer was not up to par, nothing seemed to work."

  While the GoPro Fusion is a very easy camera to hold, record and operate the ability to download and convert these files to usable videos is labor intensive.  The software that pairs with the camera is ""okay"" at best and the conversion process is very SLOW...even on a high-powered computer.  I would also like to note that the highest quality conversions in 5k crash my computer.  I'm running an i7-6700k 4 GHz with 32 GBs of Ram and a GeoForce GTX 1080.  This should not be a problem, but it is.  Still happy with the purchase, frustrated with its downfalls.

  Picked up a unit and put it to the test and love it. The software update made a huge difference in stabilization and a night and day improvement. Make sure you use the APP and get the updates!  The stitching is so seamless you cannot even tell where it is which is the key differentiation to the competition. The entire over capture feature is hands down the reason to buy this!

  Everything started with the purchase of the most overpriced, under-performing, unreliable camera I have ever seen. Bought a Session 5 right before a 28 days cruise. The camera just wouldn't work properly at all. After reading through the sea of complains in the forums a potential reason was shown (the memory card type could be the problem). I don't know enough about hardware to fully understand the complexity behind memory cards but if it is a subject so complicated then a memory card of the ""right"" type should be sold with the cameras. I wanted to return the camera right away but being in a cruise I missed my return window. I took the lost of $300 and moved on deciding to never give GoPro a chance with their poorly designed cameras. Today I get an email asking for my GoPro experience feedback. Decided that providing some constructive criticism would be useful. To my surprise, the survey had absolutely nothing to do with my experience with a GoPro camera at all! The survey was full of questions regarding demographics. I was in such a disbelief that GoPro would mask a demographic data collection survey as an experience feedback survey to bait people into providing data for GoPro's marketing. Maybe if your engineering team worked as well as your marketing team then GoPro wouldn't have the massive amount of unsuccessful products (such as Karma drone) out on the market. I had already been disappointed by GoPro beyond  repair but after this baiting survey, I will campaign as much as possible against your horrible products and your amazingly dirty social engineering methods of business.

  Die Fusion ist der Beginn der Zukunft. Insbesondere bei Action-Aufnahmen muss man sich nicht mehr darum kümmern den gewünschten Bildausschnitt auch wirklich ins Bild zu bekommen. Man positioniert die Kamera einmal und nimmt nur noch auf. Danach bearbeitet man alles am PC und sucht sich die gewünschten Perspektiven aus. Overcapture bietet unglaubliche Effekte und ist einfach genial. Die Bildqualität erstklassig, zumal man zB für YouTube Videos in der Regel auf 1080 Auflösung herunter geht. Also Bilder mega. Kamera selbst, gut, aber mit Verbesserungspotential. Die hervorstehenden fischaugenartigen 2 Linsen sind extrem exponiert und ohne jegliche Schutzoption. Die Möglichkeiten des Linsenschutzes wie bei Gopro Hero gibt es bisher nicht. Hier muss noch etwas nachgeholt werden. Ausserdem fehlt eine Öse an der Kamera um eine Sicherungsleine zu befestigen. Da man die Fusion ohne Case verwendet, und es auch keines dafür gibt, kann man an der Kamera selbst keine Safetyline anbringen, nur an der Schraube."

  This camera is definitely the coolest camera I own (and that is a lot of cameras) ... the possibilities creatively, are endless. The Fusion studio is a little slow to stitch clips together (fine with photos) however, the outcome is worth it. Just keep the clips short."

  Decepcionado. Acostumbrado a go pro me parece que hay cosas que, o se han hecho rápido, o es problema de la novedad de producto. La cámara es pesada en comparación p.e a la insta360, pero aún así el HW creo que es adecuado y en parte cumple. El SW es el mayor problema. El del móvil es pobre para este tipo de cámara y además pierde conexión. El de OSX es básico y con problemas, no entiendo como el comprimir en H264 no mantiene la resolución de partida. Esto implica siempre tratar en PRORES y para el almacenamiento no es óptimo. Dado el tiempo que se dedica a renderizar es poco operativo su uso."

  Das Konzept der Kamera gut, es macht viel Spaß damit aufzunehmen. Es wäre alles gut, wenn da nicht die notwendige Nachbearbeitung wäre. Die Windows-Software, die dafür nötig ist (GoPro Fusion Studio) ist schlichtweg eine Katastrophe. Sie beansprucht für die Bearbeitung _alle_ Systemressourcen, auch jeglichen freien Speicherplatz auf der Systemplatte. Das wäre ja auch noch in Ordnung, leider stürzt sie im Schnitt bei jedem zweitem Render-Prozess ab und gibt den belegten Festplattenplatz NICHT WIEDER FREI. Das Windows-System ist dadurch nur noch eingeschränkt nutzbar. Die Anfrage an den GoPro Support (nur in englisch) offenbart die generelle Taktik: ABWIMMELN. Ich habe das Problem geschildert, der Mitarbeiter hat es bis zum Schluss nicht verstanden und die Konversation endete mit der Aufforderung, ""ich solle jemanden Fragen, der sich mit Computern auskennt"". Dazu muss ich sagen, ich bin selbst Softwareentwicker. Es wurde mir versprochen dass sich ein ""Experte"" mit mir per eMail in Verbindung setzt, das ist nach mehrere Wochen immer noch nicht passiert. Jegliche erneute Anfragen zum gleichen Thema werden konsequent ignoriert. Für mich gibt es nur einen Begriff dafür: UNPROFESSIONELL.

  Battery life is only upto 45 mins. It's not good for beginners as it's a bit complicated when you want to transfer the footage from camera to your storage device. Low light is a problem. Doesn't capture great images / videos in low light. Final wording, if this is not required please don't purchase, specially for personal use. Pros can still manage to spend money as it's their need of the hour.

  I used this camera this winter and the quality is amazing.  For a good discount, all the 'quirks' of this camera can be looked past and overcome, if you can work with the footage on a computer.  Like other GoPro cameras this one too will randomly freeze up sometimes, but pulling the battery out to reset the camera fixes this.  If I had paid the full original price, I would have returned it, but I paid less than half of that."

  This is my 4th GoPro. Not like other gopro easy to use which I understand since this fusion is 360 camera. Good thing is catching wide 360 videos without seeing selfie stuck. Also long battery life. A little tricky thing is you have to use two SD cards together all the time and I still didn't figure out how to stiches videos. I basically just screen recording when I play the videos on my phone. Plus the video quality is way lower than regular gopro I have.

  Not sure what the GoPro max is like but as far as my first 360 camera goes, it’s great bang for buck. GoPro software for editing is surprisingly easy to use. I’ve read reviews about the Ricoh Theta, Insta 360 and Max. The fusion probably doesn’t do as good a job as the above with respect to removing the seam between both lenses but at the price, it’s good enough.

  The big let down of almost all 360 cameras I’ve used has been the user interface or the image stitching. Took the GoPro fusion to the climbing centre last night and the results are impressive. The camera produces great quality high resolution images and the user interface on the GoPro app allows you to make great photos in seconds. Videos are not as convinient to do. But that’s the nature of 5K resolution unfortunately."

  I wanted to really like this camera, but GoPro's desktop and mobile app to process the 360 footage needs more work before it's ready for consumer use. The minimum computer requirements for the desktop app is totally understated by GoPro. The graphics card needs to be at least a GTX 1050 for reasonable stitching times (6 minutes of stitching time for every minute of footage). The mobile app for iOS needs proper stitching for 360 stills. 360 video stitches fine on the phone, but stitching for 360 stills is practically non-existent. How did software quality control miss this??? And there's also no way to control the horizon orientation when panning around 360 footage - it just spins in seemingly random directions. GoPro, please take a look at how Ricoh did their app for the Theta and take some notes.

  Die Actioncam ist für vielfältige Einsätze bestens geeignet. Sie ist mit ca. 7,5 x 7,5 x 4 cm sehr kompakt und robust gebaut. Die Oberfläche ist gummiert und was besonders gut ist, alle Kanten sind abgerundet. Die beiden Kameraaugen stehen logischerweise hervor, sonst könnte man den 360 Grad Winkel nicht gut abdecken. Sicherlich ist hier besondere Vorsicht geboten, denn schon beim Hinlegen liegt die Kamera immer auf der Linse. Das mitgelieferte kompakte Cover ist daher sehr praktisch, weil man die Kamera dort sehr gut, schnell und sicher verstauen kann. Die beiden Klappen für den Akku und die beiden microSDHC-Karten einerseits und den USB-C Anschluss andererseits sind als Schub- und Gelenk-Klappen ausgebildet. Sie lassen sich trotz der Dichtungen leicht bedienen. Die Funktionsweise ist relativ einfach, zuerst wird die Klappe mit der innenliegenden Dichtung mit dem Schubdeckel fest angedrückt und der Schubdeckel eingeschoben. Dadurch wird verhindert, dass sich die Dichtung mit der Zeit abreibt und undicht wird. So eine Konstruktion ist immer eine sehr gute und dichtungsschonende Variante, die auf Langlebigkeit ausgelegt ist. Sicherlich müssen die Dichtungen und die Schubrillen auf Sauberkeit überprüft werden, denn Schmutz und Staub können die Klappenmechanik erheblich beschädigen. Die Tasten zum Öffnen der Klappen sowie die beiden Bedienschalter sind gut zugänglich, bedienbar und funktionieren sehr gut. Das Display zum Einstellen der Funktionen ist ca. 1,5 x 1,5 cm groß und gut beleuchtet. Die Symbole, Zahlen und Buchstaben sind gut lesbar. Auch die Bedienung durch die beiden Tasten ist sehr gut. Die Menüführung und die Einstellungen sind selbsterklärend und genau so muss es sein. Hier können Einstellungen für Videos, Photos, Zeitrafferaufnahmen, Sprachsteuerung und die Verbindungsart für die Kommunikation mit dem Smartphone, PC-Tablet usw. vorgenommen werden. Es stehen beide Bänder für WLAN zur Verfügung 2,4 GHz und 5 GHz. Der Akku ist ein Li-ion Akku mit 2620 mAh. Schade, dass hier nicht zwei AA-Standard-Eneloope-Akkus mit zusammen 5000 mAh gewählt wurden, denn vom Platz her würden sie passen. Man könnte schnell mal zwischendurch die Akkus wechseln und zusätzlich hatte man noch die doppelte Kapazität. Die zwei nicht im Lieferumfang beinhalteten microSDHC-Karten müssen immer sehr schnelle Karten sein. Wir verwenden bereits bei unseren Smartphones und Dashcams die SanDisk microSDHC mit UHS-I oder höher sowie mit Class 10. Langsame SD-Karten werden der Actioncam nicht gerecht. Der GoPro typische Anschluss lässt sich nach dem Lösen der beiden Arretierklappen herausschieben und je nach Bedarf austauschen."

R2OMA8CHVALO6Q,Even The Best Camera Won't Work Without Better Software & Hardcore Hardware,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've had several GoPros (a half dozen over the years), and I'm a early-adopter of consumer 360 video. This camera was specifically purchased to replace my Samsung Gear 360 which easily produces 360 video, but has sub-par video quality. Given that the GoPro Omni runs about $1,400, the GoPro Fusion is a steal at less than half that cost."
R3W3JCMV8YE5BQ,"So far impressed, but the complete lack of easily found documentation makes it difficult for the uninspired.","Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I will update this review in a few days, there are a couple of statements I need to state.  First, the documentation is completely void from this camera.  If you don't have the appetite for ""figuring it out"" then don't bother.  GoPro, you can do better in sending a simple 10 page quick start guide, I know all the materials are in the video but...  I first did not know where the buttons were, I finally figured that out, then by accident paired with the phone and from there things became easier.  The software at first glance looks fine, of course I will figure out more once I start using it more heavily."
RYFUBELV4SJC2,Awesome 5.2K Spherical Videos; not so awesome software.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'll start by saying that the Fusion delivers really clean 5.2 K spherical video and it's really fun to shoot with. Using the free Fusion Studio app on Mac (haven't tried the Windows version), you can render out very nice video images with gimbal-like stabilization. It's the best stabilization I've ever seen on a 360 camera. Even with walking and micro vibrations, the hardware/software combination yields buttery-smooth movement. Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls ""overcapture"" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage. So GoPro has to improve how the app is using the CPU. Assuming your clips are relatively short and you're patient, (let the clips render overnight) the camera is truly the best 360 camera I've used (and I've used a lot of them).

  The camera seems to take excellent 360 photos, and short videos as far as I can see from my mobile gopro app. But the big caveat is that the desktop software, Fusion Studio, that you are supposed to use to unload all of the massive images and videos to your desktop simply does not work.  Trying to connect my camera to my mac has taken hours, and it still isn't working.  It is NOT simple plug and play.  This is clearly a known issue due to the number of times the connectivity problem appears in online gopro help forums, but there is simply no substantive help that works anywhere.  This is extremely frustrating - you spend time taking videos and you rely on the camera, and you cannot unload the footage without popping the cards out and unloading those - that is a much more complex method than on a normal gopro  or other digital camera. Very very frustrating for such an expensive camera.

  The iPhone app is buggy, but you don't need it, it's a 360, think about your placement of the camera and shoot.  The images are night and day over my Insta360 Nano, as it can shoot in night and day too.  The Fusion software running on a 2010 Mac Pro 5.1, is so far rock steady doing almost 100 clips.  My Mac Pro is a basic Intel cheese grater model with 24GB RAM and a Sapphire 580 8GB GPU.  The render time is approx 11 minutes to render 1 minute of 5.2k Cineform.  I do own DaVinci Resolve Studio 15 (the paid one, you can buy a Resolve Dongle on an auction site for cheap).  The Cineform 5.2k files playback a little choppy on editing, but not enough of a problem to edit with."

  Hardware and image quality are fantastic. Required stitching software is as buggy as everyone says.  I render on a desktop and rendering time is not a problem (10 min of footage takes ~6-7 min to cineform at full resolution). However the fusion software regularly crashes. Worse, the “recover project” option only results in more crashing. Therefore, user has to start project from scratch regularly. It is infuriating. The fusion desktop software is useless. Without the software, the hardware is useless.  The camera came out 1.5 years ago. If they haven’t fixed the software yet, they probably never will.

  I bought this after considering a Nikon KeyMission for some time. It got better reviews and was a higher megapixel rating so I hoped the image quality would be better as well. The movie quality is pretty good. Rendering the video though requires a pretty new or reasonably powerful computer. The software is slow to scan and not as intuitive as I'd like. YouTube videos helped me more than the GoPro website. The camera has a GPS so there is telemetry data available, however it appears the GoPro software won't make use of it. Hopefully that will change in the future. It's a shame to not be able to use that and stay in the GoPro software. I had to download a third party application and I'm still learning how to use that properly. Overall I'm happy with it, just wish the software was simpler to use.

Shooting (and editing) in 360 is not only a learning curve, but introduces technical challenges in storage and rendering speed. The problems I see people run into can be experienced with any 360 camera. Overall I think the Fusion is in the top 3 for consumer level 360 cameras in the price range.

  Hello everyone. I had trouble, not with the purchase or the seller or the camera, but with getting the two sides of the camera into the stitching program. After much trouble, and getting a ""218"" error from the go pro fusion software, I finally found the simple thing that nobody mentions about importing footage. If you buy a fusion, put both folders from GPfront and GPback (the front and back folders that show up on the cards when you record) into another folder together....call it ""footage"" or whatever. Then the GoPro software will import without the ""218"" error (and no explanation).......GoPro should have this right up front in their website or documentation....but that would be too easy. .Just trying to save someone else the hassle of researching this simple answer. cheers

  Linking to your phone is pretty much impossible and the app is a nightmare to use. You've need Fusion studio to put the videos together, but it won't run on most computers. Since Fusion Studio won't run on the 3 computers we've tried it on, I'd have to say picture quality is poor/nonexistent. Is submit a video, but have yet to have anything that works from the Fusion. Don't believe the GoPro hipe, it's a bad product from a bad company. Would be better off using a cell phone camera.

  This is the perfect camera for hiking shots. You can walk with it and the stability does great. Or set it down at a bend in the trail to get a cool shot. Just a fun camera to use.

  All right boys and girls be prepared for this camera not to do anything you expect it to do. And try finding somewhere to Store all your videos. Because the cloud does not support GoPro 360 footage. You actually can't even use the GoPro app to do anything with this I am very unhappy with this camera. It does not do anything that is advertised to do. I feel like Amazon and GoPro just spit in my face by selling me this camera. I am very unhappy

R3AOOYQ89XQ4D4,Prosumer Camera lacking even BASIC image controls.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Short and sweet.  How can a camera of this price, category, and technology omit the MOST BASIC OF ALL CAMERA FUNCTIONS?  I can think of no camera released in the past 10yrs that costs 1/10th of this one that blows off the implementation of Exposure and White Balance Control.  Literally, you CANNOT lock your exposure or WB and cannot choose shutter speeds.  Sure..AUTO EVERYTHING with a simple +/- EV control can work fine in easy environments... but go in and out of shadows, mixed light...shoot time lapse, etc and watch that exposure and white balance bounce all over the place.  I honestly expected more from GoPro and it never even crossed my mind that these BASIC features would be excluded.  For me, I may just have to return it as I cannot accept these limitations no matter how great it looks in bright even sunlight.  PLEASE FIX THIS and I may repurchase.  Interesting that there are so many comments marked ""Helpful"" when they are ""rah rah""...but there are some big-time shortcomings that people should consider and not be swayed exclusively by only positive reviews.  One additional - Be sure you don't mind a 10x-15x to 1 rendering ratio on even the latest of computers.  1min of footage will take 10-15min to render.  For reference, my latest top of line Macbook Pro it's 10 to 1.

  Fusion is a great idea but unlike most of the GoPro products, it needs a lot of refinements. I had lots of issues in making it work for the first time and am still getting used to it in making decent videos. But my main frustration is that GoPro does not make it clear that it is useless underwater - the primary reason I bought it; the optics simply do not work underwater, image becomes soft and you can clearly see stitching lines."

That is to say when you convert a 360 video to a regular video you can only re-frame in one static direction. If the subject of the video moves in relation to the initial direction you have directed the overcapture then you are stuck.  For me this is a major shortcoming. I am fine with long transfer and render times if the output is good (which it is). However, if you can not create the cool panning effects or in and out of the 'small planet view' then what is the point of shooting 360? Insta360 and Rylo apps both support this feature in the free editing app. I realize there are plugins for Adobe Premiere that allow this, but this is not a solution for those of us with investments in other editors.

  I owned Fusion a year but rarely used it. The major issue is the workflow, even it has Gopro mobile App, but the App is not very useful. In the mobile App, what you can do is probably just previewing your pics or videos. If you want to share 360 photos or videos through social media, you have to use the desktop app to render/export it. The entire process is also very time-consuming."

  I bought the GoPro Fusion just because I was curious whether 360 photography/videography actually makes sense for someone who doesn't use a VR headsets and is not into extreme sports. After playing with the Fusion just for a few minutes I already got pretty excited and then took it with me on a 2 week trip through Japan. The photos and videos I could take with the Fusion are simply incredible - the fish eye and little planet videos look simply cool and the 360 photos/videos let you feel you're back on vacation even weeks after you're back home. The Fusion will from now on go on every trip with me! My only wish for the future, please make the GoPro apps and FusionStudio better (much better ;))

  The Fusion captures everything in clear, sharp high definition. Unlike a normal single field-of-vision video or photo camera the image is a spherical/fish-eye virtual reality (VR) 360 degree view, so nothing is missed. But, if the intension is to share anything but VR, the output needs to be precisely edited to make useable.  Operating this camera entails a number of software programs and an app as well downloading and installing files, etc. This is not a plug and play device."

  Potentially great hardware that will never be great because gopro doesn't care. The problem is the software, it's terrible. And since their software is the gatekeeper this means your footage is useless. Specifically the desktop app crashes, doesn't get updated often enough, and is horrendously slow. Worse yet the Android software blocks use unless you have a compatible phone. So after waiting months for it to work on my OP5, I get an OP6, and I'm out in the cold again.

  This is a great camera.  The video it takes looks amazing, better than anything else I've seen in the price range.  The pictures are great too.  It really adds an extra level to your vacation pics and vids when you can look around 360 degrees. I looked at a few alternatives, and the Fusion just had the best, natural looking videos, with the best color.  The app and desktop software is where it really falls off.  The app isn't fully functional on Samsung phones for some reason (only the world's largest phone manufacturer, that's all). You can't share videos from the phone.  The desktop software requires a really high-end CPU and a decent video card, and it's still very slow to render.  While on vacation I was able to render 360 pics on a cousins cheap laptop, but had to wait until I got home to render 360 video."

The software would not render files on my i7 2015 computer with 12 gb of ram  and would run super slow on a MacBook .

  initially, I was impressed by the feel of this camera and the immediate preview on my phone was great to, but it literally ended there. Despite trying various usb ports, cables, and numerous suggestions found online I was unable to pull the footage off the camera and into the GoPro software. even when I pulled the SD cards and manually downloaded it, the software wouldn't recognize the files and spit out errors. its a shame because it was super simple to use out of the box but anything beyond hitting record is a nightmare. it also has constant issues turning on, i find myself having to pull the battery out, put it back in, just to get it to turn on. once its on, it works great, the voice commands and all, but getting it on is a challenge most of the times. I had it for about 48 hours and tried for nearly the same amount of time to pull the footage I captured on the first day. no luck, so, until they fix the software and crap ton of other issues, stay away from this bs.

  I am GoPro obsessed.  I have 2 Sessions, Heros 4,6,7 (got to recycle the older versions) and now the Fusion.  Granted, I have never owned a 360 camera before, but I have been very satisfied with the GP Fusion.  I don't do too many fancy things with it.  We are an all Mac household so I stitch and edit videos through my desktop.  It runs more slowly on smaller devices but runs very well on my higher processor desktop.  Everything else pales in comparison to the 360 if you take into consideration the 3D nature of the videos.  The video quality will catch up eventually, given the new software in beta.  I am very much looking forward to these improvements and remain a hardcore avid customer/fan of GoPro.  Now if only there's a way to stick a fusion to your body whilst doing active extreme sports, that would be fantastic. ;)

  Like an exotic sports car the up-front cost is only a portion of the capital investment you are making. Sure, if you already have an expensive smartphone you can connect to the GoPro fusion via the app and get some usability, but this approach has limitations with respect to stitching the image together into one, clear, spherical image. Where the GoPro Fusion really shines is when the images are processed on a desktop computer, the image is beautiful as if you are looking through a literal ""eye in the sky"". The one caveat (and it's a big one) is your desktop computer must be an absolute BEAST of a machine in order to process the footage in any reasonable amount of time, if at all before the RAM is exceeded and you have to give up hours later. To put this in perspective, you will probably need a video-processing desktop currently priced at $2K-$3K+. I have been successful at making clips up to 5 minutes long work on my computer with 8GB RAM and 2G DDR5 GPU, however, that is only after I had to tune down the resolution to 2K, and the stitching process still took over an hour. On the back end, the stitched videos are not compatible with past versions of the GoPro Studio software, which is a remarkably good and intuitive means of video editing (GoPro why did you move away from this?). As an alternative, GoPro opted to offer a GoPro Fusion toolbox for an Adobe video-editing software, which is only available via a subscription basis, minimum $20 per month with no option to straight-up purchase. At face value, this is an excellent option for a professional in the video-editing field, but I have neither the patience nor the presence to justify changing what has already worked in the past for me. I gave Adobe an honest attempt, but perhaps my computer was not up to par, nothing seemed to work."

  While the GoPro Fusion is a very easy camera to hold, record and operate the ability to download and convert these files to usable videos is labor intensive.  The software that pairs with the camera is ""okay"" at best and the conversion process is very SLOW...even on a high-powered computer.  I would also like to note that the highest quality conversions in 5k crash my computer.  I'm running an i7-6700k 4 GHz with 32 GBs of Ram and a GeoForce GTX 1080.  This should not be a problem, but it is.  Still happy with the purchase, frustrated with its downfalls.

  Picked up a unit and put it to the test and love it. The software update made a huge difference in stabilization and a night and day improvement. Make sure you use the APP and get the updates!  The stitching is so seamless you cannot even tell where it is which is the key differentiation to the competition. The entire over capture feature is hands down the reason to buy this!

  Everything started with the purchase of the most overpriced, under-performing, unreliable camera I have ever seen. Bought a Session 5 right before a 28 days cruise. The camera just wouldn't work properly at all. After reading through the sea of complains in the forums a potential reason was shown (the memory card type could be the problem). I don't know enough about hardware to fully understand the complexity behind memory cards but if it is a subject so complicated then a memory card of the ""right"" type should be sold with the cameras. I wanted to return the camera right away but being in a cruise I missed my return window. I took the lost of $300 and moved on deciding to never give GoPro a chance with their poorly designed cameras. Today I get an email asking for my GoPro experience feedback. Decided that providing some constructive criticism would be useful. To my surprise, the survey had absolutely nothing to do with my experience with a GoPro camera at all! The survey was full of questions regarding demographics. I was in such a disbelief that GoPro would mask a demographic data collection survey as an experience feedback survey to bait people into providing data for GoPro's marketing. Maybe if your engineering team worked as well as your marketing team then GoPro wouldn't have the massive amount of unsuccessful products (such as Karma drone) out on the market. I had already been disappointed by GoPro beyond  repair but after this baiting survey, I will campaign as much as possible against your horrible products and your amazingly dirty social engineering methods of business.

  Die Fusion ist der Beginn der Zukunft. Insbesondere bei Action-Aufnahmen muss man sich nicht mehr darum kümmern den gewünschten Bildausschnitt auch wirklich ins Bild zu bekommen. Man positioniert die Kamera einmal und nimmt nur noch auf. Danach bearbeitet man alles am PC und sucht sich die gewünschten Perspektiven aus. Overcapture bietet unglaubliche Effekte und ist einfach genial. Die Bildqualität erstklassig, zumal man zB für YouTube Videos in der Regel auf 1080 Auflösung herunter geht. Also Bilder mega. Kamera selbst, gut, aber mit Verbesserungspotential. Die hervorstehenden fischaugenartigen 2 Linsen sind extrem exponiert und ohne jegliche Schutzoption. Die Möglichkeiten des Linsenschutzes wie bei Gopro Hero gibt es bisher nicht. Hier muss noch etwas nachgeholt werden. Ausserdem fehlt eine Öse an der Kamera um eine Sicherungsleine zu befestigen. Da man die Fusion ohne Case verwendet, und es auch keines dafür gibt, kann man an der Kamera selbst keine Safetyline anbringen, nur an der Schraube."

The overcapture has to be done and coule get boring if the video is more than 2min, cannot be done while travelling. Battery consuming on camera and phone/device. 32+32GB cards do about 70min recording.

  Ich habe mir die Kamera geholt, weil ich einige sehr beeindruckende Videos auf YouTube gesehen habe. Diese wurden mit dem GoPro Fusion Studio sowie mit Adobe Premiere 2018 erstellt. Leider funktionieren die GoPro Plugins bei Premiere 2019 nicht. Ein sinnvolles Bearbeiten der Roh-Videos ist somit nicht möglich. Der GoPro Support schweigt sich aus, obwohl etliche User in diversen Foren das gleiche Problem haben. Somit ist die Kamera für mich völlig unbrauchbar. Sollte das Problem nicht binnen einer Woche gelöst sein, geht die Kamera zurück. Schwache Vorstellung von GoPro. Aber die Karma haben sie ja auch nicht hinbekommen.

Avec cette camera, la première désillusion c'était avec l'app pour le smartphone Android: il n'y a qu'un petit nombre de phones avec lesquels la camera peut se connecter. Le mien, naturellement, n'était pas entre les modèles compatibles. Le problème n'est même pas lié aux performances des phones: le mien est un Huawei produit en 2018, de bonne qualité.

  Decepcionado. Acostumbrado a go pro me parece que hay cosas que, o se han hecho rápido, o es problema de la novedad de producto. La cámara es pesada en comparación p.e a la insta360, pero aún así el HW creo que es adecuado y en parte cumple. El SW es el mayor problema. El del móvil es pobre para este tipo de cámara y además pierde conexión. El de OSX es básico y con problemas, no entiendo como el comprimir en H264 no mantiene la resolución de partida. Esto implica siempre tratar en PRORES y para el almacenamiento no es óptimo. Dado el tiempo que se dedica a renderizar es poco operativo su uso."

  Das Konzept der Kamera gut, es macht viel Spaß damit aufzunehmen. Es wäre alles gut, wenn da nicht die notwendige Nachbearbeitung wäre. Die Windows-Software, die dafür nötig ist (GoPro Fusion Studio) ist schlichtweg eine Katastrophe. Sie beansprucht für die Bearbeitung _alle_ Systemressourcen, auch jeglichen freien Speicherplatz auf der Systemplatte. Das wäre ja auch noch in Ordnung, leider stürzt sie im Schnitt bei jedem zweitem Render-Prozess ab und gibt den belegten Festplattenplatz NICHT WIEDER FREI. Das Windows-System ist dadurch nur noch eingeschränkt nutzbar. Die Anfrage an den GoPro Support (nur in englisch) offenbart die generelle Taktik: ABWIMMELN. Ich habe das Problem geschildert, der Mitarbeiter hat es bis zum Schluss nicht verstanden und die Konversation endete mit der Aufforderung, ""ich solle jemanden Fragen, der sich mit Computern auskennt"". Dazu muss ich sagen, ich bin selbst Softwareentwicker. Es wurde mir versprochen dass sich ein ""Experte"" mit mir per eMail in Verbindung setzt, das ist nach mehrere Wochen immer noch nicht passiert. Jegliche erneute Anfragen zum gleichen Thema werden konsequent ignoriert. Für mich gibt es nur einen Begriff dafür: UNPROFESSIONELL.

  Battery life is only upto 45 mins. It's not good for beginners as it's a bit complicated when you want to transfer the footage from camera to your storage device. Low light is a problem. Doesn't capture great images / videos in low light. Final wording, if this is not required please don't purchase, specially for personal use. Pros can still manage to spend money as it's their need of the hour.

  The big let down of almost all 360 cameras I’ve used has been the user interface or the image stitching. Took the GoPro fusion to the climbing centre last night and the results are impressive. The camera produces great quality high resolution images and the user interface on the GoPro app allows you to make great photos in seconds. Videos are not as convinient to do. But that’s the nature of 5K resolution unfortunately."

  This was a huge disappointment.  I read many reviews how bad the required software was but I thought they would have fixed it by now.  I was wrong.  The software was dead, would not even start the process and just crashed and I have a new computer with the newest Windows 10.  I tried to get support but they required me to PAY to get support!!"

  Absolute beast. If you are a vlogger. Know that your content is gonna sky rocket off the roof!! Amazing purchase. Super happy. Only tiny downside is time to stitch footage. But thats gonna happen with any 5.2K 360 footage.

  I wanted to really like this camera, but GoPro's desktop and mobile app to process the 360 footage needs more work before it's ready for consumer use. The minimum computer requirements for the desktop app is totally understated by GoPro. The graphics card needs to be at least a GTX 1050 for reasonable stitching times (6 minutes of stitching time for every minute of footage). The mobile app for iOS needs proper stitching for 360 stills. 360 video stitches fine on the phone, but stitching for 360 stills is practically non-existent. How did software quality control miss this??? And there's also no way to control the horizon orientation when panning around 360 footage - it just spins in seemingly random directions. GoPro, please take a look at how Ricoh did their app for the Theta and take some notes.

  Molti i difetti di questa videocamera: scalda come un forno a microonde (ma se dovete cuocerci sopra qualcosa è ottima!) si spegne automaticamente dopo 15 minuti di ripresa (se la cosa che dovete cuocere ha tempo di cottura di 15 minuti esatti però è funzionale), non va per niente bene per gli sport estremi perché troppo delicata e non esiste un case protettivo dedicato (comunque cuocere non rientra fra queste attività estreme)."

  Per un oggetto che costa quasi 700 euro mi aspetteri la massima cura nell'imballaggio e nel trasporto. Purtroppo il trasporto è affidato a SDA, quindi il peggiore in assoluto. Se poi la confezione della GoPro viene semplicemente inserita in una scatola Amazon ed un po di carta solo da una parte, il risultato è scontato: scatola mezzo aperta da entrambi i lati, tutta schiacciata, e dentro che sballottolava la mia nuova GoPro Fusion."

  GoPros habe ich schon seit der zweiten Generation, und mich immer mal wieder mehr oder weniger damit rumärgern dürfen: Halbgare Firmware, Akkuprobleme, unzuverlässige Connectivity - alles keine Einzelprobleme, sondern Zeichen einer zu frühen Marktveröffentlichung, bei denen die Bugs entsprechend mit in Kauf genommen wurden."

  la macchina e le sue foto sono incredibili, ma il programma che fornisce gopro per fare l'unione delle immagini è qualcosa di abominevole, a parte la lentezza (considerato il pc da 4000 euro che ho), il programma si blocca ogni due secon, non riconosce le clip o quasi mai la gopro e devo manualmente scaricare tutto sul pc. il programma non è personalizzabile e quindi di base vi farà una esportazione sempre ad impostazioni di fabrica. la macchina è uscita da ormai diverso tempo e siamo ancora alla versione 1.0. questo è inaccettabile. per non dimenticare che l'app non è supportata da quasi nessun telefono

  Le premier modèle reçu a délivré des images avec des rayures, invisibles sur l'objectif, mais bien présentes en photo et vidéo (c'est inexploitaple, même pour le grand public). J'ai demandé un échange. Le second modèle... fait la même chose. On ne m'a pas proposé un troisième échange, j'attends donc un remboursement. Je ne sais pas si je n'ai pas de chance ou si je suis tombé sur une série défectueuse."

  Ich habe mir heute den ganzen Abend um die Ohren geschlagen um dann im Internet zu lesen, dass die Kompatibilität zu Android Handys sehr gering ist. Es heißt zwar immer bei gopro, dass die aktuellen Modelle der Smartphones benutzt werden sollen, allerdings funktioniert die gopro App nicht mit dem Samsung Note 8 (dachte es ist ziemlich neu)."

  In terms of the quality of the camera there is no doubt that this has the same excellent quality as the other GoPro cameras. The videos are crisp, vibrant, beautiful, and the battery literally lasts forever. However, that's about all that's praise-worthy for this camera."

  Totale Enttäuschung, Gopro hat massiv nachgelassen. Hatte vorher die Hero 4. Die Fusion macht zuerst einen guten Eindruck, doch hat massive Detailschwächen: Beim Surfen eingesetzt, kommt Sand durch die Dichtungen und macht das Öffnen des Akkuschachts extrem schwergängig. Für den anderen Schachthat sich die Abdceckung beim Öffnen komplett verabschiedet. Konnektivität funktioniert nur zu Quick, nicht zu Mac. Das ist echt Mist, und hätte ich bnoch die Originalverpackung, würde ich das Ding einfach zurückschicken. Schade, so macht Gopro sich selbst kaputt

  Die Actioncam ist für vielfältige Einsätze bestens geeignet. Sie ist mit ca. 7,5 x 7,5 x 4 cm sehr kompakt und robust gebaut. Die Oberfläche ist gummiert und was besonders gut ist, alle Kanten sind abgerundet. Die beiden Kameraaugen stehen logischerweise hervor, sonst könnte man den 360 Grad Winkel nicht gut abdecken. Sicherlich ist hier besondere Vorsicht geboten, denn schon beim Hinlegen liegt die Kamera immer auf der Linse. Das mitgelieferte kompakte Cover ist daher sehr praktisch, weil man die Kamera dort sehr gut, schnell und sicher verstauen kann. Die beiden Klappen für den Akku und die beiden microSDHC-Karten einerseits und den USB-C Anschluss andererseits sind als Schub- und Gelenk-Klappen ausgebildet. Sie lassen sich trotz der Dichtungen leicht bedienen. Die Funktionsweise ist relativ einfach, zuerst wird die Klappe mit der innenliegenden Dichtung mit dem Schubdeckel fest angedrückt und der Schubdeckel eingeschoben. Dadurch wird verhindert, dass sich die Dichtung mit der Zeit abreibt und undicht wird. So eine Konstruktion ist immer eine sehr gute und dichtungsschonende Variante, die auf Langlebigkeit ausgelegt ist. Sicherlich müssen die Dichtungen und die Schubrillen auf Sauberkeit überprüft werden, denn Schmutz und Staub können die Klappenmechanik erheblich beschädigen. Die Tasten zum Öffnen der Klappen sowie die beiden Bedienschalter sind gut zugänglich, bedienbar und funktionieren sehr gut. Das Display zum Einstellen der Funktionen ist ca. 1,5 x 1,5 cm groß und gut beleuchtet. Die Symbole, Zahlen und Buchstaben sind gut lesbar. Auch die Bedienung durch die beiden Tasten ist sehr gut. Die Menüführung und die Einstellungen sind selbsterklärend und genau so muss es sein. Hier können Einstellungen für Videos, Photos, Zeitrafferaufnahmen, Sprachsteuerung und die Verbindungsart für die Kommunikation mit dem Smartphone, PC-Tablet usw. vorgenommen werden. Es stehen beide Bänder für WLAN zur Verfügung 2,4 GHz und 5 GHz. Der Akku ist ein Li-ion Akku mit 2620 mAh. Schade, dass hier nicht zwei AA-Standard-Eneloope-Akkus mit zusammen 5000 mAh gewählt wurden, denn vom Platz her würden sie passen. Man könnte schnell mal zwischendurch die Akkus wechseln und zusätzlich hatte man noch die doppelte Kapazität. Die zwei nicht im Lieferumfang beinhalteten microSDHC-Karten müssen immer sehr schnelle Karten sein. Wir verwenden bereits bei unseren Smartphones und Dashcams die SanDisk microSDHC mit UHS-I oder höher sowie mit Class 10. Langsame SD-Karten werden der Actioncam nicht gerecht. Der GoPro typische Anschluss lässt sich nach dem Lösen der beiden Arretierklappen herausschieben und je nach Bedarf austauschen."
